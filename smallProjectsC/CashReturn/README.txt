This program implements a simple algorithm that prompts the user to input the amount of money owed by a store clerk in cents. For example, 1 dollar 55 cents would be represented as 155 cents.

The algorithm then calculates the minimum number of coins required to make up the total amount, and provides the user with the optimal combination of physical coins to meet this value.
