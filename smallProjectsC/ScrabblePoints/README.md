# Word Point Game

This program assigns a point value to every letter of the alphabet. It prompts player 2 to come up with a word following a word from player 1. The program then takes the input from both players, indexes into the point array that is "connected" to the alphabet array, and then prints who the winner of the round is, based on points.

## Usage

1. Run the program
2. Player 1 inputs a word
3. Player 2 inputs a word
4. The program calculates the point values for both words and announces the winner of the round
5. Repeat steps 3-4 until the game is finished

## Example

Player 1 inputs "cat"
Player 2 inputs "tiger"
The program calculates the point values for "cat" and "tiger" based on the assigned point values for each letter, and announces the winner of the round.
