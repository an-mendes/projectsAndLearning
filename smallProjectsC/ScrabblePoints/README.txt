This program assigns a point value to every letter of the alphabet.
It prompts the user for a word that the player 1 has come up with, following a word from player 2.
The program then takes the input from both players, indexes into the point array that is "connected" to the alphabet array, and then prints who the winner of the round is, based on points.
